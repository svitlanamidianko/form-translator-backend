Hey Future Self, 

There are the commands you gotta run to start the project

`python3 -m venv venv`
`source venv/bin/activate`
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
`python app.py`

Svilana, you also need to create a folder called /routes and put __init__.py and api_routes.py in it.



and to create a frontend project

`npm create vite@latest my-web-app --template react`
